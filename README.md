### Project description

This project aims to classify some [IMDB cinema review](https://keras.io/api/datasets/imdb), and to predict whether the written reviews are rather positive or not.

To do so, 3 approaches are implemented, tested with some diverse techniques to verify if the results can be improved.

The first one is the bayesian naive classification

The second one is a logistic regression

The third and last one is a machine learning solution based on FastText and embedding words
